Dijkstra's Algorithm
====================
    implemented by Neelay Junnarkar
    
Introduction:
     This is an implementation of Dijkstra's Algorithm, and finds the shortest path from one node in a graph to another.
 
 Specification Completement:
     To do so, this program implements a method that takes an adjacency list as a representation for the graph, and a source node
 and a destination node. The method returns a sequence of nodes which represents the shortest path from the source node to the
 destination node in the graph. This fulfils the specifications for this program.
 
 Errors:
    One shortfall of this implementation is that it does not handle many error cases, and assumes that the user will use
 the program correctly. However, the implementation still adheres to the specifications set out for it.

    I used wikipedia's list of possible ways to implement an adjacency list as the basis of my adjacency list.
